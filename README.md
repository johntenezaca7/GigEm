# Gig'em
Gig'em is a crowdfunding application for local music shows.

## Functionality
Gig'em is designed to connect bands with opporunities for shows they might not otherwise be able to identify. Musicians propose shows in local areas, then local fans can commit to shows. Once a threshold commit value is reached (much like similar crowdfunding applications), these fans can then fund the show.

## Installation
Clone the git repository. You will then need to fill in the config folder files with information for:

* Firebase
* Twilio
* Google Developer API Key
 
Then:

```

## Developer Experience
